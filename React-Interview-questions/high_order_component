HOC

HOC is a pattern where a function takes a component as an argument and return new components in other words it enhance the functionality of the orginal component so return enhanced original component.

e.g:

const newComponent = highOrderComponent(originalComponent)

highOrderComponent is a function which takes original component as an argument and return new component.

e.g:
const ironMan = suit(tonyStark)

where suit is a function which enhances tonyStark and return ironMan.
