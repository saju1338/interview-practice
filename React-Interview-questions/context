Context: 
Context provides a way to pass data through a component tree to the specific component, without going through each component of the component tree.

Suppose we have one parent component called appComponent and it has 3 child component A, B and C.
B has one child component called D 
C has two child components called E and F .
Now, we want to pass the username which we have stored in appComponent to the component A, D and F. 
Passing username from appComponent to A is easy as 'A' component is direct child of appComponent but passing the userName from appComponent to D is difficult as first we need to pass the username to B and then to D.
To overcome this problem we use context.

below is the example of context syntax:
/*
import React from 'react';

const UserContext = React.createContext();

const UserProvider = UserContext.Provider;
const UserConsumer = UserContext.Consumer;

export {UserProvider, UserConsumer};
*/

pass the UserProvider in the parent component and pass the UserConsumer to the component where we want to use the UserProvider value.
