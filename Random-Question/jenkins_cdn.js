//What is Jenkins and why it is used:

Jenkins is a continuous integration tool.
Continuous integration is a process in which all the code is integrates as soon as possible in the application.

Suppose you are a manual tester and you need to test your new release. So what will you do? You start testing every feature of the application manually. So if you have 10 old features to test and 1 new feature to test. You will manually be testing the 11 features.

We test old features to ensure that they work fine after the new features have been added. This is called Regression Testing

Here is where selenium comes into the picture. We use selenium to automate the regression test so that you can only focus on testing the new feature and let selenium test the remaining old 10 features.

Now,

Suppose you have a release on a weekend at 9 in the night. Your manager tells you to run the selenium test. You have plan with your girlfriend to go out with her.

Would you like to skip the date? NO. Would you say no to your Manager? I doubt so.

Here is where Jenkins comes into the picture. Jenkins is used for Continous Testing. With Jenkins you can schedule your test that needs to get executed and it will run on a particular event, time [nightly, every 2 hours, every week, every month etc].

Thatâ€™s it.
