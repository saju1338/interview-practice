What is the difference between regular function and arrow function:

* Regular function may be anonymous or may have a name, but arrow functions are always anonymous. 

* Hoisting is not possible in Arrow function. 
    Hoisting means calling a function before declaring it. 

*  Arrow function doesn't have their own 'this' keyword. 'this' in arrow function points to it's parent or you can say that 'this' will be borrowed from the outer context , so 'this' in arrow function will point to the same Object, where it is pointing in the outer object .
