Q: What are CSS preprocessors?

Ans:
Css preprocessors are special css files which contains variables, functions and other functionalities which are not possible with normal css.

Q: Advantages of using preprocessors?

Ans:
Join multiple files: you can create different file for each component and then import them all in main css file.

Avoid repetitions: see the below example:

Basic CSS

.maindiv{
Margin:5px;
Padding:2px;
border:1px double;
}
.subdiv1{
Margin:5px;
Padding:2px;
border:2px double;
}
.subdiv2{
Margin:5px;
Padding:2px;
border:3px double;
}

Now the same code using a CSS Preprocessor

.maindiv{
Margin:5px;
Padding:2px;
border:1px double;
}
.subdiv1{
.maindiv;
border:2px;
}
.subdiv2{
.maindiv;
Border:3px;
}

Nested Syntax: Nesting of classes in CSS makes it easy to target DOM elements and saves you time. Nesting also makes it
tremendously easy to edit CSS files.
